Dear Concern, 

Iâ€™ve completed a performance test on a frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server domain www.banglapuzzle.com 

20 Concurrent Requests with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 1.62 And Total Concurrent API requested: 140.
50 Concurrent Requests with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 3.7 And Total Concurrent API requested: 350.
100 Concurrent Requests with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 3.9 And Total Concurrent API requested: 700.

While executing 100 concurrent requests, found 118 requests got connection timeout and error rate is 16.86%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 400 API calls with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and  let me know if you have any further queries.
